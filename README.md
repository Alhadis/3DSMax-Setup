3DSMax-Setup
============

The final installment of the *"Crap Nobody Else Should Care About"* trilogy,
following my [Mac config repo](https://github.com/Alhadis/.files) and my
[Atom theme/preferences setup](https://github.com/Alhadis/Atom-PhoenixTheme).

In other words, you can quit reading, because this won't interest you. =)

This is just a repo to maintain my heavily-customised workflow in 3D Studio Max.
I'd add documentation so other users can benefit from the scripts I've written,
but to be honest, my preferred workflow probably makes no sense to anybody else.
