		<!-- Optional. Defaults to true. Determines if a provider is enabled or not. If this is set to false, the provider will not show up in the Asset Tracking dialog. -->
		<Enabled>true</Enabled>

		<!-- Optional.  The project root is typically defined by the path in which the current 3ds max scene is opened. This may or may not be within a Provider`s workspace. For instance, if it is known that content coming from a particular provider will also reside under a known folder regardless of where the 3ds max scene is opened, you might want to set a FixedProjectRoot which will replace the 3ds max scene path -->
		<FixedProjectRoot>C:\myFixedProjectRoot</FixedProjectRoot>

		<!-- Optional. This allows you to provide an optional executable to launch when `Launch Provider` is chosen by the user. Instead of allowing the provider launch an executable, the specified executable will be launched instead. -->
		<AltProviderExecutable>C:\Tools\MySpecialProviderLauncher.bat</AltProviderExecutable>

		<!-- Optional.  For ATS Providers that are integrated through the MS SCC interface, you can specify an optional filename that will contain provider specific project information.  This file will be created in the same location as the scene file.  In many cases, specifying a MSSCC project file will reduce the provider interaction required to connect. -->
		<MSSCCProjectFile>SampleProvider.scc</MSSCCProjectFile>

		<!-- Optional.  For ATS Providers that are integrated through the MS SCC interface, you can specify an optional full path to the MS SCC dll. This can be useful if there are PATH conflicts with side-by-side installation. -->
		<MSSCCDllFullPath>C:\MSSCC\SCC.dll</MSSCCDllFullPath>

		<!-- Optional.  For ATS Providers that are integrated through the MS SCC interface, you can specify an optional search path to the MS SCC dll. This can be useful if there are PATH conflicts with side-by-side installation. -->
